                     We are early adopters of new technology and techniques and are obsessive in finding ways that these can benefit our clients.</span> 
                     We have been featured by Google in their promotional material, we have had top Facebook apps, we are regularly featured in the internet press.
                     We don't do run of the mill.</p>

                 <blockquote>We design for usability. We know what works and aren't afraid to say it! It's all for the best in the end</blockquote>
                <p class="left-block">Most recently we have moved a large portion of our hosting services onto "The Cloud". 
                Using both Amazon's elastic cloud (EC2) and Rackspace's cloud we are now able to provide our clients with unrivalled scalability and resilience. 
                We have geeks and are proud of them.</p>

                    <h2>Amazon Web Services AWS</h2>
                    <p>Since 2006 Amazon has been providing cloud based hosting solutions through it's web services arm â€“ Amazon Web Services (AWS).
                     At 3ev we were early adopters of this and have become well known for our achievements in this field. 
                     In 2010 Amazon launched their partnership programme and invited us along.</p>

                    <h2>TYPO3 Development</h2>
                    <p>TYPO3 is an enterprise level open source content management system (CMS).
                     Since 2001 we have developed sites using this for clients across Europe, including The NHS,
                      Rackspace, The Economist and Abbott Meade Vickers, amongst others.
                       We've got loads of experience with TYPO3, this includes integrating with many other platforms. 
                       TYPO3 can form as much, or as little of the project as you want it to.</p>
